- ðŸ‘‹ Hi!, Iâ€™m Gopal Srivastava, a Biological Sciences PhD candidate @ Louisiana State University
  
- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on**
  1. LLM based binding affinity prediction of small molecules
  2. simulataneous node classification to predict binding affinity of small molecules
  3. scRNA analysis project to identify the cancer stem cells and their driver genes in colorectal cancer
  4. GNN based gut microbial metabolism of the human metabolites
     
- ðŸ’» **Past Projects:**
  1. Predicting the gut microbial metabolism of the human metabolites
  2. Predicting GNN based drug pair synergy prediction. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data science and machine learning to solve bio relevant problems
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cancer genomics and utilizing bioinformatics tools for GWAS data processing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on GWAS based machine learning studies
